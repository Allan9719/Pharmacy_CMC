## 24. Biosimilar CMC Pathway

### 24.1 Biosimilar Development is Fundamentally a CMC Exercise

Unlike innovator biologics where clinical efficacy drives the program, biosimilar development is anchored in **analytical similarity**. The entire regulatory pathway (351(k) in US, Article 10(4) in EU) depends on demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar is highly similar to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences.

### 24.2 Stepwise Development

```
Analytical Similarity (foundation)
    ↓
Functional Similarity (binding, bioassay)
    ↓
Clinical PK/PD (bridging)
    ↓
Clinical Efficacy/Safety (abbreviated, in one indication)
    ↓
Extrapolation to other indications (based on totality of evidence)
```

### 24.3 Reference Product Characterization

- **Sourcing**: Purchase multiple lots of the US-licensed reference product (and EU reference for global filing)
- **Lot-to-lot variability**: Characterize 10-15+ lots to establish the quality range for each CQA
- **Comprehensive analytical characterization**: Primary structure, higher-order structure, glycosylation, charge variants, size variants, potency, process-related impurities

### 24.4 Analytical Similarity Assessment

**Statistical approaches:**

| Tier                   | Attributes                              | Statistical Method                                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 1 (most critical) | Potency, glycosylation, binding         | Equivalence testing (90% CI within quality range) |
| Tier 2 (major)         | Charge variants, oxidation, aggregation | Quality range comparison                          |
| Tier 3 (minor)         | Visual appearance, pH, osmolality       | Raw data comparison                               |

**FDA Guidance:** "Development of Therapeutic Protein Biosimilars: Comparative Analytical Assessment and Other Quality-Related Considerations" (2019)

### 24.5 Process Development for Biosimilars

- **Reverse engineering**: Develop process to match the target product profile derived from reference product characterization (not from a known originator process)
- **Cell line development**: New cell line producing a product with matching CQA profile
- **Process optimization**: Tune upstream/downstream to achieve desired glycosylation, charge variant, and purity profiles
- **Iterative**: Multiple rounds of process modification to converge on analytical similarity

### 24.6 Interchangeability

- Additional requirement beyond biosimilarity (US only)
- Requires switching studies demonstrating no increased risk from alternating between reference and biosimilar
- Designated as interchangeable by FDA → allows pharmacy-level substitution without prescriber intervention

## 25. Combination Products and Fixed-Dose Combinations

### 25.1 Drug-Device Combination Products

**Regulatory framework:** 21 CFR Part 4; jurisdiction determined by primary mode of action (CDER vs. CDRH)

**Common combination products:**

| Product Type                          | Device Component                  | CMC Considerations                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-filled syringes with autoinjector | Autoinjector device               | Human factors, device reliability, extractables/leachables from device                             |
| Metered-dose inhalers (MDI)           | Valve, actuator                   | Delivered dose uniformity, aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD), propellant compatibility |
| Dry powder inhalers (DPI)             | Inhaler device                    | Device-formulation interaction, moisture sensitivity, device robustness                            |
| Transdermal patches                   | Adhesive system, backing membrane | Adhesion testing, drug release rate, residual drug, skin irritation                                |
| Drug-eluting stents                   | Stent platform                    | Drug loading, elution kinetics, coating integrity, sterile processing                              |
| Intravitreal implants                 | Implant device                    | Biodegradable polymer, drug release over months, sterility                                         |

**Additional CMC requirements for combination products:**
- Design History File (per 21 CFR 820 for device constituent)
- Human factors/usability engineering (FDA guidance)
- Device-specific stability testing (mechanical, functional)
- Biocompatibility testing (ISO 10993 series)

### 25.2 Fixed-Dose Combinations (FDCs)

**CMC challenges unique to FDCs:**
- **Drug-drug compatibility**: Binary/ternary excipient compatibility studies between APIs
- **Dissolution requirements**: Discriminating dissolution conditions for each API individually
- **Content uniformity**: Must meet USP <905> for each API
- **Stability**: Monitor degradation of each API and potential cross-degradation (API A catalyzing degradation of API B)
- **Manufacturing**: May require separate granulations blended together, bilayer tablets, or coated pellets in capsule

**Example (Trikafta):** Triple-combination CFTR modulator — three distinct APIs with different physicochemical properties, each requiring its own impurity control and dissolution specification within a single fixed-dose tablet.

### 25.3 Orally Inhaled and Nasal Drug Products (OINDP)

- **Unique CQAs**: Delivered dose uniformity (DDU), aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD by cascade impaction), moisture content, device actuation force
- **FDA-specific guidance**: "Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) and Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) Drug Products" — extensive CMC and bioequivalence guidance
- **Analytical methods**: Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI), Next Generation Impactor (NGI), dose content uniformity apparatus
- **Device variability**: Must validate across multiple device lots

## 26. Nitrosamine Impurity Assessment

### 26.1 Background

In 2018, NDMA (N-nitrosodimethylamine) contamination was discovered in valsartan API from a specific manufacturer, triggering a global crisis. This expanded to multiple sartan drugs and then to ranitidine, metformin, and other products.

### 26.2 Regulatory Response

- **FDA**: "Control of Nitrosamine Impurities in Human Drugs" guidance (2021, updated 2023)
- **EMA**: Article 5(3) referral — mandatory risk assessments for all MAH
- **Health Canada, PMDA, TGA**: Harmonized requirements
- **Scope**: All chemically synthesized drug products, biologics, and OTC products

### 26.3 Risk Assessment Methodology

**Root causes for nitrosamine formation:**
1. Use of nitrite salts or nitrosating agents in API synthesis
2. Presence of secondary/tertiary amines + trace nitrites
3. Contaminated raw materials or solvents
4. Recycled materials/solvents carrying over nitrosating agents
5. Drug substance degradation forming nitrosamine under acidic conditions
6. Interaction between drug and excipients or packaging materials (especially for NDSRIs)

### 26.4 Acceptable Intake (AI) Limits

| Nitrosamine | AI (ng/day) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| NDMA        | 96          |
| NDEA        | 26.5        |
| NMBA        | 96          |
| NIPEA       | 26.5        |
| NDIPA       | 26.5        |
| NDBA        | 26.5        |

For NDSRIs (Nitrosamine Drug Substance Related Impurities), AI is determined from compound-specific carcinogenicity data or read-across.

### 26.5 Analytical Methods

- **LC-MS/MS**: Required sensitivity at ng/level (ppb in drug substance, sub-ppm in drug product)
- **GC-MS/MS**: For volatile nitrosamines
- **Method challenges**: Matrix effects, low levels, multiple analytes in single method
- **Confirmatory testing**: Required when risk assessment identifies potential for nitrosamine formation

### 26.6 Regulatory Timelines

- Initial risk assessment: Completed (deadlines passed for most products)
- Confirmatory testing: If risk identified, testing must be completed and results shared with agencies
- **Ongoing obligation**: Any manufacturing change must be re-evaluated for nitrosamine risk

## 28. Drug Master Files (DMFs)

### 28.1 What is a DMF?

A Drug Master File is a submission to FDA that may be used to provide confidential detailed information about facilities, processes, or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of drugs.

### 28.2 DMF Types

| Type         | Content                                                               | Common Use                                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type I**   | Manufacturing site, facilities, operating procedures, personnel       | Rarely used; largely obsolete                                 |
| **Type II**  | Drug substance, drug substance intermediate, drug product             | **Most common** — used by API manufacturers                   |
| **Type III** | Packaging material                                                    | Container closure systems, particularly for complex packaging |
| **Type IV**  | Excipient, colorant, flavor, essence, or material used in preparation | Novel excipients                                              |
| **Type V**   | FDA-accepted reference information                                    | Rarely used                                                   |

### 28.3 How DMFs Work

- **DMF holder** (e.g., API manufacturer) files the DMF with FDA
- DMF holder provides a **Letter of Authorization** to the NDA/ANDA/IND applicant
- Applicant references the DMF in their application
- **FDA reviews the DMF only when referenced** — DMFs are not independently reviewed or approved
- DMF holder maintains the DMF with annual updates

### 28.4 DMF vs. ASMF vs. CEP

| Aspect              | DMF (FDA)                              | ASMF (EMA)                                                      | CEP (EDQM)                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Structure           | Single confidential document           | Split: Applicant's Part (open) + Restricted Part (confidential) | Certificate referencing Ph. Eur. monograph |
| Review              | Only when referenced in an application | Assessed with each MAA                                          | Assessed independently by EDQM             |
| Approval status     | No standalone approval                 | No standalone approval                                          | Independent certificate issued             |
| Strategic advantage | Flexibility                            | Transparency to applicant                                       | Faster MAA assessment                      |

### 28.5 Strategic Considerations

- DMFs protect API manufacturer's proprietary process information while allowing drug product applicants to reference it
- Due diligence on DMF quality is essential when sourcing APIs from DMF holders
- A poorly maintained DMF can delay NDA/ANDA approval

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**ttributable    | Data traceable to the person who generated it                  |
| **L**egible         | Data readable and permanent                                    |
| **C**ontemporaneous | Recorded at the time of the activity                           |
| **O**riginal        | First recording of the data (or a verified true copy)          |
| **A**ccurate        | Data is correct, truthful, and reflects what actually happened |
| + **C**omplete      | All data included, no selective reporting                      |
| + **C**onsistent    | Data follows logical sequence (timestamps, audit trails)       |
| + **E**nduring      | Recorded on durable media, maintained for retention period     |
| + **A**vailable     | Accessible for review throughout retention period              |

### 29.3 21 CFR Part 11 / EU GMP Annex 11

**Electronic records and electronic signatures requirements:**
- System validation (computerized system validation — CSV)
- Audit trail: Secure, computer-generated, time-stamped record of all changes
- Access controls: Unique user IDs, role-based permissions, periodic access reviews
- Electronic signatures: Legally equivalent to handwritten signatures when compliant
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Audit trail review: Must be part of routine batch record review

### 29.4 Common Data Integrity Findings

- Shared login credentials
- Disabled audit trails
- Backdating of records
- Selective reporting (deleting or hiding failing test results)
- Uncontrolled use of standalone systems (e.g., laboratory balances, pH meters without audit trails)
- Insufficient audit trail review during batch release
- Lack of CSV for laboratory instruments

- Trending of EM data with alert and action limits
- Identification of recovered organisms to species level for Grade A/B
- Investigation required for any action limit excursion

### 30.4 EU GMP Annex 1 (2022 Revision) — Key Changes

The 2022 revision of Annex 1 is the most significant GMP update for sterile products in decades:
- **Contamination Control Strategy (CCS)**: Required holistic document assessing all contamination risks

| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Process maturity**        | How well-characterized is the process? Is there a design space? Are CPPs defined? | No DoE data, poorly defined process parameters         |
| **Scalability**             | Has the process been run at commercial scale? What scale-up challenges exist?     | Only lab-scale data, untested critical steps at scale  |
| **Manufacturing site**      | GMP-compliant? Recent inspection history? Capacity available?                     | Warning Letters, 483s, capacity constraints            |
| **Supply chain**            | Single-source for critical materials? Starting materials IP-protected?            | Sole-source API, no backup suppliers                   |
| **Analytical methods**      | Validated? Stability-indicating? Transfer-ready?                                  | Unvalidated methods, no forced degradation data        |
| **Stability**               | Adequate data for claimed shelf life? Any adverse trends?                         | Short stability history, unexplained degradation       |
| **IP around manufacturing** | Process patents? Freedom-to-operate?                                              | Originator process patents blocking alternative routes |
| **Regulatory filing**       | Module 3 quality? IND/NDA complete and consistent?                                | Incomplete Module 3, unresolved FDA questions          |
| **Comparability**           | Process changes during development? Bridging data available?                      | Multiple process changes without comparability data    |
| **CMC team**                | Experienced CMC team? Key person dependencies?                                    | CMC knowledge concentrated in 1-2 individuals          |

### 31.3 CMC Risk Scoring

| Score  | Level         | Implication                                                                                          |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Green  | Low risk      | Standard development, no major concerns                                                              |
| Yellow | Moderate risk | Addressable with investment and time; factor into deal terms                                         |
| Red    | High risk     | Potential deal-breaker; may require process redesign, site change, or significant timeline extension |

### 31.4 CMC-Related Deal Terms

- **Tech transfer timeline and milestones** with acceptance criteria

## 32. Generic Drug (ANDA) CMC Requirements

### 32.1 How ANDA CMC Differs from NDA CMC

ANDAs (Abbreviated New Drug Applications) rely on bioequivalence to the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) rather than independent safety and efficacy data. CMC requirements are adapted accordingly.

### 32.2 Key ANDA CMC Requirements

| Requirement            | Detail                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Q1/Q2 Sameness**     | Qualitatively (Q1) and quantitatively (Q2) same inactive ingredients as RLD (for oral solids — other dosage forms have different rules) |
| **Dissolution**        | Comparative dissolution profiles in multiple media; f₂ similarity factor ≥50 (or biowaiver per BCS)                                     |
| **Bioequivalence**     | In vivo PK study demonstrating 90% CI of Cmax and AUC within 80-125% of RLD                                                             |
| **BCS Biowaivers**     | ICH M9 / FDA guidance: BCS Class I drugs may qualify for biowaiver based on in vitro dissolution data                                   |
| **Stability**          | At least 3 batches, 3 months accelerated + 6 months long-term at time of filing; shelf life based on available data                     |
| **Process validation** | Required at time of ANDA approval (on-site verification batch) or committed before commercial distribution                              |
| **Specifications**     | Generally aligned with RLD product; compendial where available                                                                          |

### 32.3 Paragraph IV Certifications and CMC

When a generic applicant files a Paragraph IV certification challenging an Orange Book-listed patent:
- **Polymorph patents**: CMC must demonstrate the generic product uses a non-infringing polymorph (or that the patent is invalid/not infringed)
- **Formulation patents**: Must design around patented excipient combinations or ratios
- **Process patents**: Must use a non-infringing manufacturing process
- CMC strategy directly impacts patent litigation risk and market exclusivity timing
